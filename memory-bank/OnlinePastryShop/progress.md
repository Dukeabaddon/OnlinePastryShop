# Progress

## What Works
- ✅ User Authentication
  - Database connection for credential verification
  - Login form validation and error handling
  - Password hashing (basic implementation)
  - Session variable creation on successful login

- ✅ Role-Based Access Control
  - Role checking from database (Admin/Customer)
  - Role-based redirection after login
  - Session verification on protected pages
  - Prevention of direct access to Dashboard.aspx by non-admin users

- ✅ Session Management
  - Session variables for user information (UserID, FirstName, LastName, UserRole)
  - User initials computation and storage in session
  - Session state maintenance across page loads
  - Session clearing on logout

- ✅ UI Updates for Logged-in Users
  - User initials circle display for authenticated users
  - Dropdown menu with profile and logout options
  - CSS styling for user UI elements
  - JavaScript for dropdown toggling

- ✅ Logout Functionality
  - Session clearing in lnkLogout_Click handler
  - Session abandonment for complete cleanup
  - Redirection to Login.aspx after logout

## In Progress
- 🔄 Password Security Enhancement
  - Implementing proper cryptographic hashing
  - Adding salt to password hashing
  - Removing temporary password validation hack

- 🔄 User Profile Management
  - Creating profile page UI
  - Implementing profile update functionality
  - Adding order history display

- 🔄 "Remember Me" Functionality
  - Persistent login cookie implementation
  - Extending session timeouts

## Not Yet Started
- ❌ Shopping Cart Implementation
- ❌ Checkout Process
- ❌ Order Management
- ❌ Product Management
- ❌ Payment Processing Integration
- ❌ Email Notifications

## Known Issues
1. Password comparison uses temporary direct comparison
2. No account recovery mechanism
3. Limited client-side validation on forms
4. No automated tests for authentication flows
5. No CSRF protection implemented yet
6. Hardcoded password handling in HashPassword method

## Next Steps
1. Fix password hashing in Login.aspx.cs
2. Implement proper password strength validation
3. Create user profile page
4. Add "Remember Me" functionality
5. Implement account recovery system

## Success Metrics
- Successfully pass security code review
- Complete test cases for authentication flows
- Ensure all admin pages have proper session validation
- Validate that non-admin users cannot access restricted pages
