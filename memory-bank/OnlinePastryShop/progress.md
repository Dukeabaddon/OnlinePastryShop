# Progress

## What Works
- ‚úÖ User Authentication
  - Database connection for credential verification
  - Login form validation and error handling
  - Standardized SHA256 password hashing implementation
  - Session variable creation on successful login

- ‚úÖ Role-Based Access Control
  - Role checking from database (Admin/Customer)
  - Role-based redirection after login
  - Session verification on protected pages
  - Prevention of direct access to Dashboard.aspx by non-admin users
  - Different master pages for different user roles

- ‚úÖ Session Management
  - Session variables for user information (UserID, FirstName, LastName, UserRole)
  - User initials computation and storage in session
  - Session state maintenance across page loads
  - Session clearing on logout for both user types
  - Admin logout functionality with proper session termination
  - Different logout paths based on user role

- ‚úÖ UI Updates for Logged-in Users
  - User initials circle display for authenticated users
  - Dropdown menu with profile and logout options
  - CSS styling for user UI elements
  - JavaScript for dropdown toggling
  - Conditional rendering based on session state

- ‚úÖ Logout Functionality
  - Session clearing in lnkLogout_Click handler (Site.Master.cs)
  - Session clearing in lnkAdminLogout_Click handler (AdminMaster.Master.cs)
  - Session abandonment for complete cleanup
  - Role-appropriate redirection after logout (Login.aspx for customer, Default.aspx for admin)
  - Exception handling in the logout process

- ‚úÖ Password Hashing
  - Consistent SHA256 hashing for all passwords
  - Removal of hardcoded special cases
  - Well-documented code for maintainability
  - Identified future security enhancements

## In Progress
- üîÑ Password Security Enhancement
  - Implementing salting mechanism
  - Adding password complexity validation
  - Exploring modern hashing algorithms (PBKDF2, bcrypt, Argon2)

- üîÑ User Profile Management
  - Creating profile page UI
  - Implementing profile update functionality
  - Adding order history display
  - User preference management

- üîÑ "Remember Me" Functionality
  - Persistent login cookie implementation
  - Extending session timeouts
  - Secure token storage

- üîÑ Account Recovery Process
  - Password reset functionality
  - Email verification system
  - Security questions implementation

## Not Yet Started
- ‚ùå Shopping Cart Implementation
- ‚ùå Checkout Process
- ‚ùå Order Management
- ‚ùå Product Management
- ‚ùå Payment Processing Integration
- ‚ùå Email Notifications
- ‚ùå Advanced Security Features (CSRF protection, 2FA)
- ‚ùå Admin User Management Interface

## Known Issues
1. No salt used in password hashing (security improvement needed)
2. No account recovery mechanism
3. Limited client-side validation on forms
4. No automated tests for authentication flows
5. No CSRF protection implemented
6. No account lockout mechanism for failed login attempts
7. No automatic session timeout handling

## Next Steps
1. Implement password hashing with salt
2. Add password strength validation
3. Create user profile page
4. Add "Remember Me" functionality
5. Implement account recovery system
6. Add security audit logging

## Success Metrics
- Successfully pass security code review
- Complete test cases for authentication flows
- Ensure all admin pages have proper session validation
- Validate that non-admin users cannot access restricted pages
- Confirm proper session termination on logout for all user types
