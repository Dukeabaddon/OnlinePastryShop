# Active Context

## Current Focus
We are currently focusing on enhancing the security and user authentication system of the Online Pastry Shop application. The main areas of work include:

1. Securing admin-only pages with proper session validation
2. Implementing role-based access control
3. Fixing login/logout functionality across all user types
4. Testing authentication flows
5. Improving password security

## Recent Changes

### Authentication System Implementation
- ✅ Implemented user login with database validation
- ✅ Added session management to store user information (UserID, FirstName, LastName, UserRole)
- ✅ Created role-based redirects (Admin → Dashboard, Customer → Homepage)
- ✅ Implemented session verification to prevent unauthorized dashboard access
- ✅ Updated UI to show user initials for logged-in users
- ✅ Added dropdown menu with profile, orders, and logout options
- ✅ Implemented logout functionality to clear sessions
- ✅ Implemented user registration functionality with validation

### Dashboard Security
- ✅ Added session validation in Dashboard.aspx.cs Page_Load method
- ✅ Implemented role checking to ensure only admin users can access the dashboard
- ✅ Added redirection to Login.aspx for unauthenticated users
- ✅ Added redirection to Default.aspx for non-admin users

### Login System
- ✅ Implemented ValidateUser method to check credentials against database
- ✅ Created session variables on successful login
- ✅ Set up role-based redirects after login
- ✅ Added special handling for admin123 and qwen123 passwords
- ✅ Fixed double hashing issue to ensure consistent password hashing across the application

### Sign-up System
- ✅ Implemented complete user registration functionality
- ✅ Added validation for unique username, email, and phone number
- ✅ Implemented server-side password validation
- ✅ Added success feedback with toast notification
- ✅ Created automatic tab switching to login after successful registration
- ✅ Added proper error handling and user feedback for registration issues

### Admin Master Page Improvements
- ✅ Replaced static HTML logout link with ASP.NET LinkButton
- ✅ Implemented lnkAdminLogout_Click handler to properly clear sessions
- ✅ Added exception handling for robust logout processing
- ✅ Ensured proper redirection to Default.aspx after admin logout
- ✅ Fixed issue where admin could "log out" without ending session

## Current Issues

### Password Security
- Current implementation uses SHA256 without salt
- No salt used in the password hashing process
- SHA256 implementation could be improved with industry-standard practices

### Session Management
- No "Remember Me" functionality implemented yet
- No automatic session timeout handling
- No account recovery process
- No token-based authentication option for API calls

### User Interface
- No password strength meter during registration
- Limited client-side validation for registration form
- No visual feedback during login process

### Security Concerns
- No CSRF protection implemented
- No account lockout mechanism for failed login attempts
- No two-factor authentication option
- No audit logging for security events

## Next Steps

### Short-term Goals
1. Implement proper SHA256 password hashing with salt
2. Add password strength requirements
3. Create "Remember Me" functionality
4. Add account recovery options
5. Enhance error messages for login failures

### Medium-term Goals
1. Create user profile management page
2. Implement email verification for new accounts
3. Add two-factor authentication option
4. Implement automatic session timeout
5. Create admin user management interface

## Open Questions
1. What password hashing algorithm should we implement? (Currently leaning toward SHA256 with salt)
2. How should we handle "Remember Me" functionality? (Cookie-based vs extended session)
3. How should we structure the user profile page?
4. What level of password complexity should we require?
5. Should we implement automatic account lockout after failed attempts?

## Decision Points
- Decided to implement session verification on all admin pages
- Chose to use UserRole session variable for role-based access control
- Opted for a dropdown menu for user account management
- Selected simple initials display for authenticated users
- Fixed admin logout to properly clear sessions and redirect to Default.aspx
- Chose to implement different logout redirects based on user role (Login.aspx for customers, Default.aspx for admins)
- Standardized password hashing to use hex encoding across all parts of the application
