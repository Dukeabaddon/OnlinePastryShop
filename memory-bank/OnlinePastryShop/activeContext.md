# Active Context

## Current Focus
We are currently focusing on enhancing the security and user authentication system of the Online Pastry Shop application. The main areas of work include:

1. Securing admin-only pages with proper session validation
2. Implementing role-based access control
3. Fixing login/logout functionality
4. Testing authentication flows
5. Improving password security

## Recent Changes

### Authentication System Implementation
- ✅ Implemented user login with database validation
- ✅ Added session management to store user information (UserID, FirstName, LastName, UserRole)
- ✅ Created role-based redirects (Admin → Dashboard, Customer → Homepage)
- ✅ Implemented session verification to prevent unauthorized dashboard access
- ✅ Updated UI to show user initials for logged-in users
- ✅ Added dropdown menu with profile, orders, and logout options
- ✅ Implemented logout functionality to clear sessions

### Dashboard Security
- ✅ Added session validation in Dashboard.aspx.cs Page_Load method
- ✅ Implemented role checking to ensure only admin users can access the dashboard
- ✅ Added redirection to Login.aspx for unauthenticated users
- ✅ Added redirection to Default.aspx for non-admin users

### Login System
- ✅ Implemented ValidateUser method to check credentials against database
- ✅ Created session variables on successful login
- ✅ Set up role-based redirects after login
- ⚠️ Currently using temporary approach for password validation (needs improvement)

## Current Issues

### Password Security
- Current implementation uses direct string comparison for passwords
- Need to implement proper cryptographic hashing and salt
- Special case hardcoding for "password123" should be removed

### Session Management
- No "Remember Me" functionality implemented yet
- No automatic session timeout handling
- No account recovery process

### User Interface
- Need to implement proper feedback for login failures
- No password strength meter during registration
- Limited client-side validation for registration form

## Next Steps

### Short-term Goals
1. Implement proper SHA256 password hashing with salt
2. Add password strength requirements
3. Create "Remember Me" functionality
4. Add account recovery options
5. Enhance error messages for login failures

### Medium-term Goals
1. Create user profile management page
2. Implement email verification for new accounts
3. Add two-factor authentication option
4. Implement automatic session timeout
5. Create admin user management interface

## Open Questions
1. What password hashing algorithm should we implement? (Currently leaning toward SHA256 with salt)
2. How should we handle "Remember Me" functionality? (Cookie-based vs extended session)
3. How should we structure the user profile page?
4. What level of password complexity should we require?
5. Should we implement automatic account lockout after failed attempts?

## Decision Points
- Decided to implement session verification on all admin pages
- Chose to use UserRole session variable for role-based access control
- Opted for a dropdown menu for user account management
- Selected simple initials display for authenticated users
