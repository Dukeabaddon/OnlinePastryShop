# Active Context

## Current Focus
We are currently updating the address and contact information across the website to reflect the new flagship store location. This includes:

1. Updating the address in the footer of Site.Master
2. Updating the address in the About.aspx page in the Flagship Store section
3. Modifying the store hours to indicate closure on Sundays with the message "Closed on Sundays to give time for rest, family, and faith."
4. Removing the "Special Schedule" link for holiday hours
5. Updating all contact information to be consistent across the website

## Recent Changes
- Added responsive design improvements to mobile layout
- Implemented new product categories on the Menu page
- Updated images for team members on the About page
- Fixed newsletter subscription form validation

## Next Steps
After completing the address and hours update:
1. Update the contact phone number on the Contact page
2. Add a notice about the new location on the homepage
3. Create a map integration with the correct location pinpoint
4. Update delivery area boundaries based on the new location

## Active Decisions
- The new store address is: "49 Quirino Hwy, Novaliches, Quezon City, Metro Manila, Philippines"
- We will remove the "San Lorenzo Shopping Center" reference as it's no longer applicable
- We will update the phone number to follow Philippines format but with random numbers
- All delivery service area information will still be limited to Metro Manila
- Sunday hours will be replaced with a closure notice emphasizing family and faith

## Considerations
- Ensure consistency of address format across all pages
- Make sure all location references are updated (header, footer, about page, contact page)
- Verify that the phone number format follows the Philippines standard (+63 format)
- Consider updating the map imagery to show the new location
