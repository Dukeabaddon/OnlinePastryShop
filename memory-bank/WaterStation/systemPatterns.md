# System Patterns

## Application Architecture

### WebForms Pattern
The application follows the ASP.NET WebForms architecture:
- **ASPX Pages**: Contains HTML markup and server controls
- **Code-Behind Files**: Contains C# code for page functionality
- **Master Page**: Provides consistent layout across the site

### UI Architecture
- **Master/Content Pattern**: Site.Master defines the base layout with ContentPlaceHolders
- **Responsive Design**: CSS media queries for different screen sizes
- **Component-Based UI**: Sections are organized into distinct components (hero section, product cards, etc.)

### Data Access Pattern
Database architecture appears to follow a traditional relational model:
- **Entities**: Users, Products, Orders, Order Details, Feedback
- **Relationships**: 
  - One-to-many between Users and Orders
  - One-to-many between Orders and Order Details
  - Many-to-many between Products and Orders (via Order Details)
  - One-to-many between Users/Products and Feedback

## Design Patterns

### Frontend Patterns
1. **Master Page Pattern**: Site.Master provides consistent layout and navigation
2. **Content Placeholder Pattern**: Different pages inject content into defined areas
3. **Responsive Grid System**: CSS grid/flexbox for layout adaptability
4. **Card Pattern**: Used for displaying products, team members, testimonials
5. **Accordion Pattern**: Used in FAQ page for expandable content
6. **Tab Pattern**: Used for categorization in products and FAQ pages

### Visual Design Patterns
1. **Hero Section**: Large header area with background image and call-to-action
2. **Card Grid**: Uniform presentation of similar content items
3. **Alternating Sections**: Light and dark background colors to separate content
4. **Icon + Text Pairing**: Visual reinforcement of textual information
5. **Call-to-Action Buttons**: Prominently displayed buttons for user actions
6. **Timeline Pattern**: Used in the About page for history display

### Interaction Patterns
1. **Scrolling Header Transformation**: Header changes appearance on scroll
2. **Carousel/Slider**: For testimonials and news items
3. **Hover Effects**: Interactive feedback on clickable elements
4. **Form Validation**: Client-side validation for user inputs
5. **Back-to-Top Button**: Appears when scrolling down the page

## Component Relationships

### Page Structure
```
Site.Master
├── Header
│   ├── Logo
│   ├── Navigation
│   └── User Menu
├── Content Placeholder (Page-specific content)
└── Footer
    ├── Company Info
    ├── Quick Links
    ├── Contact Info
    └── Social Links
```

### User Flow
```
Landing Page
├── Product Browsing
├── User Registration/Login
├── Product Selection
├── Order Placement
└── Order Confirmation
```

## Code Organization

### Naming Conventions
- **PascalCase**: Class names, properties, and methods
- **camelCase**: JavaScript variables and functions
- **kebab-case**: CSS classes and IDs

### File Structure Pattern
- **Page-specific**: Each page has its own ASPX, code-behind, and designer file
- **Asset Organization**: CSS, JS, and images in separate directories
- **Configuration Separation**: Different configs for development and production

### Styling Approach
- **Global Variables**: CSS variables for colors and fonts
- **Component-Based**: Styles organized by UI component
- **Mobile-First**: Base styles for mobile with media queries for larger screens
- **Utility Classes**: Reusable classes for common styling needs
