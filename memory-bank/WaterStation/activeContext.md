## Current Focus
The immediate focus is on fixing the login functionality and improving the user feedback system by implementing toast notifications instead of browser alerts.

## Recent Changes
- Basic UI structure and navigation implemented
- Login/signup modals created in Site.Master
- Oracle database connection configured in Web.config
- Toast notification system added but not fully integrated
- **Fixed client-side JavaScript for login, signup, and password reset forms to properly use PageMethods and toast notifications**

## Current Issues

### Login Functionality Issues (Fixed)
The investigation revealed several issues with the login system:

1. **JavaScript Form Handling:**
   - The original JavaScript was targeting incorrect element IDs
   - It was looking for a form with id 'loginForm' which didn't exist in the HTML
   - It was looking for elements with IDs 'loginUsername' and 'loginPassword' which had different rendered IDs due to ASP.NET naming

2. **Form Submission Handling:**
   - The JavaScript event handlers weren't properly intercepting the form submissions
   - The client-side validation was incomplete

3. **Modal Management:**
   - After successful login/signup, the modals weren't being properly closed

### Implemented Fixes
1. **JavaScript Form Handling:**
   - Updated all form handlers to use proper ASP.NET ClientID references
   - Added proper event listeners for all forms
   - Implemented proper form validation before submission

2. **WebMethod Integration:**
   - Ensured proper calls to PageMethods for all authentication actions
   - Added error handling for all AJAX calls

3. **Toast Notification Integration:**
   - All authentication results now display toast notifications
   - Success and error messages are properly displayed

### Remaining Issues to Address
1. **Database Connection:**
   - Need to verify Oracle connection is working properly
   - Test queries against the user table

2. **Server-Side Authentication:**
   - Ensure server-side validation and error handling is consistent
   - Verify session management is working correctly

## Next Steps
1. **Test Login Functionality:**
   - Test the login, signup, and password reset workflows
   - Verify toast notifications are displaying correctly

2. **Test Database Connection:**
   - Verify Oracle connection is working properly
   - Test queries against the user table

3. **Complete User Account Features:**
   - Implement remaining user profile functionality
   - Add account management features

## Active Decisions
- Use the existing toast notification system for all user feedback
- Use PageMethods for client-side authentication
- Ensure proper error handling and user feedback throughout the authentication flow
