# WaterStation Project Rules

## Naming Conventions
- ASP.NET controls follow camelCase with descriptive names (e.g., loginUsername, btnLoginSubmit)
- JavaScript functions follow camelCase (e.g., showToast, openModal)
- CSS classes use kebab-case (e.g., user-sidebar, modal-content)

## Code Patterns
- Use ASP.NET WebMethods for AJAX functionality
- Toast notifications should be used for all user feedback instead of browser alerts
- All database operations should use parameterized queries for security
- Client-side validation should be complemented with server-side validation

## Project Structure
- Master pages (Site.Master, AdminMaster.Master) contain common layout elements
- Content pages extend master pages for specific functionality
- JavaScript functionality is included at the bottom of pages or in separate files
- CSS styles are defined in external stylesheets or in style blocks in the master page

## Authentication Flow
1. User submits login form (either through server-side or client-side processing)
2. Credentials are validated against the Oracle database
3. On success, user session is created and user is redirected
4. On failure, user is shown error message via toast notification

## Database Conventions
- Oracle 11g database with Oracle.ManagedDataAccess.Client provider
- Connection string stored in Web.config
- Parameterized queries for all database operations
- Proper exception handling for database errors

## UI Standards
- Responsive design that works on mobile and desktop
- Consistent color scheme and styling
- Modal dialogs for forms and interactive elements
- Toast notifications for user feedback
- Font Awesome icons for UI elements

## Development Practices
- Test database connections and queries before implementation
- Validate both client-side and server-side
- Use proper error handling and user feedback
- Keep code modular and maintainable
