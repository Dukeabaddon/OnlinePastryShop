# Progress

## What Works
- Main website structure implemented with Site.Master
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS
- Homepage with featured products and promotional sections
- About page with company history and team information
- Menu page with product categories and items
- Contact page with form and store information
- User authentication system fully implemented:
  - Login with username/email and password
  - Session management with user information
  - Role-based access control (Admin vs Customer)
  - Session verification to prevent unauthorized access
  - User profile UI elements (initials circle, dropdown menu)
  - Logout functionality with session clearing
- Role-based redirects (Admin → Dashboard, Customer → Homepage)

## What's In Progress
- Proper password hashing implementation (currently using direct comparison)
- Enhanced security features for authentication
- User profile page development
- Updating contact information and address across the site
- Finalizing the checkout process
- Implementing payment gateway integration
- Setting up email notifications for orders
- Optimizing mobile experience for product pages

## Current Status
The website is fully functional with all core features implemented. User authentication is complete, including role-based access control that ensures only admin users can access the dashboard. The UI has been updated to show user-specific elements like the initials circle and dropdown menu. Login sessions persist across page reloads, and users can log out which clears their session. The next focus is on enhancing security with proper password hashing and implementing the user profile page.

## Known Issues
- Simple password comparison instead of proper hashing
- No "Remember Me" functionality yet
- No account recovery options
- Contact form submission needs backend implementation
- Some responsive layout issues on extra small screens
- Map integration needs updating to show new location
- Order tracking functionality not yet implemented
- Product search functionality needs optimization
